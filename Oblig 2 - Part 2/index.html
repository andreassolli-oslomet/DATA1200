           <p>Mahora, Hastings is characterised by
            <br>wide roads, concrete footpaths and
            <br>quarter-acre plots. This could be any-
            <br>where in New Zealand, except for the
            <br>structure that stands on the corner
            <br>of Duke and Ngaio Streets, a cliff face
            <br>of glass screening Perspex louvres,
            <br>bookended by triangular walls and
            <br>propped by a glant roof.
            <br>_________ The church, St James,
            <br>was designed by Len Hoogerbrug
            <br>(1929-2019) and the foundation stone
            <br>was laid in 1962.
            <br>_________ The design's interlocking
            <br>prisms and vertical emphasis give the
            <br>composition a Gothic feel. Otherwise,
            <br>it is largely absent of conventional
            <br>iconography. There is no steeple.
            <br>Landscaping is spartan, though
            <br>Calvinist would be a better word.
            <br>The building is painted concrete
            <br>masonry set between piers with a
            <br>rough cast finish. The roof is covered
            <br>in Decramastic pressed-steel tiles.
            <br>as common a suburban material as is
            <br>possible to find. The one concession
            <br>to type is a large timber cross that
            <br>rises through an open grid of columns
            <br>and beams.
            <br>_________ When first published, St
            <br>James was captured by Duncan
            <br>Winder: characteristic of his photog-
            <br>raphy, the sky is bright, the lighting
            <br>even and geometry crisp.
