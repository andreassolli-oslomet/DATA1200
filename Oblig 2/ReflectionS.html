    <p>When making my wireframes I quickly decided on how I wanted the different devices to look, I felt like giving the phone user less pictures to have to look at, due to the phone being a lot smaller than a normal pc screen. The original wireframes include landscape mode pictures which I take self-critic for not drawing more in line with what the actual pictures look like, which is portrait mode. The most difficult part to translate from wireframe to actual code was maybe to get everything to stay in the middle of the screen for both devices. When I had tried to do similar stuff in the past it would always get ruined during scaling. However, some research made me aware of the @media rule, which helped me organize and scale everything in the way I wanted it to be. Looking back at my wireframes I believe I made them a bit too simple and easy for myself so I therefore did my best to be creative afterwards, like adding a bit smaller pictures for phones, height wise. As well as adding a hover option for screens. Adding the hover option was a bit tricky, but after adding it and sorting the images after the date they were taken I think it turned out really well and quite like I was aiming for. In order to not have the hover option conflict with phones, I added a clickability option for the dates as well, making it usable on phones. Another challenge when scaling the devices was changing the size of the pictures. I opted to use Adobe Photoshop in order to create a few smaller versions of the pictures and then used the <picture> attribute to set the different sizes depending on the screen width. After doing some research regarding <picture> vs <img>+srcset I figured since I wanted the pictures cropped for phones that the <picture> attribute was the most fitting.
